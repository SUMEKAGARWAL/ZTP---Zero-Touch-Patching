**Zero Touch Patching (ZTP) Automation Tool**



**Description**


The Zero Touch Patching (ZTP) is an automation tool designed to simplify and streamline the patching process in our operations. The tool, written in Bash, consolidates all the pre-checks and post-checks required for patching, which previously depended on multiple internal tools, into one comprehensive solution.

With ZTP, all the necessary checks, including health checks and verification of findings, can be performed with the click of a button, making the patching process more efficient and reliable.

**Features**


**One-click Operation**: Automates the entire patching process, including pre-checks and post-checks.
Pre-checks: Performs necessary pre-checks before starting the patching process.
**Health Checks**: Checks the health of the systems before and after the patching process.
**Findings Verification**: Verifies whether findings get dropped or not after patching.
**Post-checks**: Performs necessary post-checks after the patching process, including scan results.


**Usage**


Navigate to the tool's main page.
Click the 'Start Patching' button to initiate the automated patching process.
The tool will perform all necessary pre-checks and post-checks automatically.
